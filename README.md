# 🎨 My First Portfolio — Two Pages of Pure HTML & CSS Magic!

Hello world! 👋  
This is my **first-ever portfolio website** https://roozz24.github.io/Roozz-s-portfolio/, lovingly crafted with just **HTML**, **basic CSS**, and a whole lot of enthusiasm — all inside **VS Code** 💻💖

It’s simple, it’s clean(ish), and it’s got... *drumroll*... **TWO WHOLE PAGES**.

---

## 📄 What’s Inside

- **Page 1 – About Me**: Who I am, what I love, and maybe a fun fact or two 👀  
- **Page 2 – Contact Me**: Want to say hi? This page has you covered ✉️

---

## 🧪 Built With

- HTML (like, the real deal)
- Basic CSS (none of that fancy flexbox wizardry... yet)
- A touch of personality 😎

---

## 🌟 Why You Should Check It Out

- It’s my first step into web dev — cheer me on!
- You might relate if you're just starting too
- It's got a contact page... which *definitely* makes it professional, right? 😜
